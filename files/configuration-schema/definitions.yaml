        Name or names under which H9 creates subdomains and publishes your
        site.  This field accepts either a single name or an array.  When an
        array is provided, the first name is the primary hostname and all
        secondary ones will be routed to it.  For each hostname, separate S3
        buckets, DNS records, and (optinally) CloudFront distros are created.
        Example "www" will produce "www.example.com"

        In addition to the hostnames property, this optional flag will add

        overrides the first name specified in the "hostnames" field.  All
        hostnames will route to the apex. However, choosing "secondary" causes
        the apex to be treated as a just another secondary hostname.

cors:
  description:
    S3 Bucket configuration for Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers.
    You may either specify the string "default", which installs a permissive CORS policy,
    or specify a detailed configuration.  The default configuration allows GET requests
    from any domain and exposes all available headers in the response.

corsRuleDefault:
  description:
    This defines the CORS rule when specifying an easy, permissive configuration.  This circumvents
    the browser's enforcement of the CORS mechanism by allowing GET requests from any domain,
    using any headers.  This is good for getting started, but consider setting this to something
    more specific as your project matures.
