        secondary ones will be routed to it.  For each hostname, separate S3
        buckets, DNS records, and (optinally) CloudFront distros are created.
        Example "www" will produce "www.example.com"

You specify the runtime and source, and Haiku will sync the code, publish a new version of your lambda, and associate it with your CloudFront distribution.

cors:

corsRuleDefault:
  description:
    This defines the CORS rule when specifying an easy, permissive configuration.  This circumvents
    the browser's enforcement of the CORS mechanism by allowing GET requests from any domain,
    using any headers.  This is good for getting started, but consider setting this to something
    more specific as your project matures.
