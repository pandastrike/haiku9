  environments:
    description:
      An environment is a collection of S3 buckets, DNS records, and
      optionally CloudFront distributions that are allocated on your behalf
      to deploy the static site.  Perhaps you wish to test changes at a
      secondary hostname without disrupting production deployments.
      Organizing configuration for those two cases into separate
      environments allows you to publish from the commandline by just
      invoking the name, not adjusting configuration each time.

      environments is an object where the keys are the name of the given
      environment and its value is its definition.  Use "h9 publish <title>"
      to invoke this configuration within the publish process.
