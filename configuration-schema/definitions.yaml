    hostnames:
      description:
        Name or names under which H9 creates subdomains and publishes your
        site.  This field accepts either a single name or an array.  When an
        array is provided, the first name is the primary hostname and all
        secondary ones will be routed to it.  For each hostname, separate S3
        buckets, DNS records, and (optinally) CloudFront distros are created.
        Example "www" will produce "www.example.com"

    apex:
      description:
        In addition to the hostnames property, this optional flag will add
        the apex domain to the list of hostnames. Choosing "primary"
        overrides the first name specified in the "hostnames" field.  All
        hostnames will route to the apex. However, choosing "secondary" causes
        the apex to be treated as a just another secondary hostname.
        Example "example.com" to "www.example.com"

            default headers, but not cache them.  You may specify a wildcard,
            which forwards all headers, but it cannot leverage caching.
