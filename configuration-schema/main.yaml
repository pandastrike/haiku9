          Organizing configuration for those two cases into separate
          environments allows you to publish from the commandline by just
          invoking the name, not adjusting configuration each time.

          environments is an object where the keys are the name of the given
          environment and its value is its definition.  Use "h9 publish <title>"
          to invoke this configuration within the publish process.
