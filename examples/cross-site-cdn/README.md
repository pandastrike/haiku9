This is a very simple example to get you started.

Install Haiku9:

```
npm install -g haiku9
```

Run the server:

```
h9 serve
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:1337/`.

To compile it, run:

```
h9 build
```

and it will build to the `build` directory.
You can then point a static Web server to the build directory
to serve the content.
